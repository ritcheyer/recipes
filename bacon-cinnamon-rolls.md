# Description
There's not a lot of time actually working in this but there are two places that you need to let it rise which will take about an hour each time so plan that time in there. One thing you can do is start the night before and get it to the pan but stick the pan in the fridge overnight, pull them out and let them get to room temperature (about 30 minutes) and then cook them. That'll cut your morning time to roughly an hour before you eat.

# Ingredients
* 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/3 cup butter, melted
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 to 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 16 slices of Bacon. As amazing as pepper crusted bacon is, wrong choice for this. A thick hickory smoke or apple wood bacon is what I usually use. 

## Filling:
* 1/4-1/3 cup butter, melted
* 3/4-1 cup packed brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

## Cream chees frosting:
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1 (8-oz.) package cream cheese, softened
* 1 (16-oz.) package powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

# Directions
## Make the dough
1. Warm the milk to 115℉ or 45℃	
2. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Add the sugar, butter, eggs, salt and 2 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be sticky).
3. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.

## Cook the bacon
1. Cook the bacon until it's done but not crispy. 

## Make the rolls
1. Punch the dough down. Turn onto a floured surface; divide in half. Roll each portion into an 11x8-in. rectangle; brush with butter. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. 
2. Lay down the bacon strips on top of the dough in the direction you're going to be cutting. 
3. Roll up starting from a long side. Pinch seam to seal.
4. Cut each into eight rolls between the slices of bacon. Place in two greased 13x9-in. baking pans. 

## Cook the rolls
1. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 1 hour.
2. Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. 
3. Cool in pans on wire racks. 

## Frost the rolls
1. Beat butter and cream cheese at medium speed until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar, beating at low speed until blended; stir in vanilla.
2. Frost rolls. 
3. Enjoy...
