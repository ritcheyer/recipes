## Ingredients

* `1` avocado
* `1/2 lb` chicken breasts, boneless skinless
* `24 fl oz` chicken broth
* `1/2` small bunch cilantro
* `2` cloves garlic
* `1` jalapeño pepper
* `1` lime
* `2` tomatoes
* `1/2` medium yellow onion
* black pepper
* cumin
* salt
* virgin coconut oil

## Directions

1. Wash the jalapeño and tomatoes. Seed and mince the jalapeño. Medium dice the tomatoes.
2. Peel and small dice the onion. Peel and mince the garlic.
3. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat.
4. Add oil to the saucepan and swirl to coat bottom. Add the onion and jalapeño. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 2-3 minutes.
5. Add the garlic and tomatoes to the saucepan. Cook for about 1 minute.
6. Slice the chicken in half horizontally to form thin fillets.
7. Add the broth, cumin, salt, and pepper to the saucepan.

9. Wash and dry the cilantro. Shave the leaves off the stems; discard the stems and chop the leaves.
10. Halve and pit the avocado; spoon out the flesh and medium dice.
11. Shred or dice the chicken and return to the saucepan. Stir in about ¾ of the cilantro (save the rest for garnishing) and lime juice.
12. Cut the remaining ½ lime into wedges.
13. Serve soup in a bowl, stir in the avocado, and garnish with the remaining cilantro and lime wedges.
